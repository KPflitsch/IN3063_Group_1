For Task 1:

Navigate to task_1/dataset and verify that the file cifar-10-batches-py is present and includes:
batches.meta
data_batch_1 -> data_batch_5
readme.html
test_batch

If the dataset is not present then please download it from
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz
then place it directly into task_1/dataset.

Then extract the downloaded file and verify cifar-10-batches-py is present adn contains the correct files.

Personally, I had to extract twice, but this may not be an issue for you. If this is the case then:
Extract cifar-10-python.tar.gz -> cifar-10-python.tar
Extract cifar-10-python.tar -> cifar-10-batches-py

There is no need to delete the archive files.

Then finally you can navigate to task_1/core_NN_implementation/trainAndPlot.ipynb and run it.



For Task 2:

Navigate to task_2/NN/task2NN.ipynb and then run it.
